# No Bypass Clicker
 A simple, user-mode autoclicker that will probably not bypass screenshare tools. Made to prove the point that a kernel-mode driver will HELP bypass every screenshare tool.
 
 dumb cunt cried about me saying it's required, when last time I checked you cannot read kernel memory from user mode without an exploit!!!
